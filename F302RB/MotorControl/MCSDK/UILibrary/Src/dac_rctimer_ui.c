  *
  * @brief RC Timer DAC User Interface implementation
  *
  * Digital to Analog Converter common component. In Motor Control context, the DAC is used for
  * debug purposes by outputting information with low overhead. It is particularly useful to
  * output fast changing analog-like data as voltage references or measured currents to compare
  * them with measurements made with other means, for instance.
  *
  * The RC Timer DAC component aims at using a PWM Timer coupled with an RC network as a DAC...
  *
  * @todo Confirm and Document... Is it really relevant to deliver this?
