  * @brief   This file provides firmware functions that implement the following features
  *          of the CCC component of the Motor Control SDK:
  *           + Set up the DAC outputs
  *           + get the current DAC channel selected output.
  *           + Set the value of the "User DAC channel".
  *           + get the value of the "User DAC channel".
