/**
 * @defgroup FCP Frame Control Protocol
 *
 * @brief A Frame Oriented transmission protocol
 *
 * This protocol is designed to transport the messages of the Motor Control Protocol
 * across physical links such as UARTs.
 *
 * The Frame Communication Protocol component serves as a base to actual implementations
 * of the protocol that operate on specific physical links. So far, the only provided implementation
 * of the protocol uses the USARTs as the physical link.
 *
 * @todo Complete documentation
