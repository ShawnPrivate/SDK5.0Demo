  * @brief   This file provides firmware functions that implement the features
  *          of the Motor Control State Machine component of the Motor Control SDK:
  *
  *           * Check that transition from one state to another is legal
  *           * Handle the fault processing
  *           * Provide accessor to State machine internal state
  *           * Provide accessor to error state
