  * @brief   This file provides firmware functions implementing the 
  *          InrushCurrentLimiter feature of the Motor Control SDK :
  *
  *          * ICL_Init() to initialize dedicated variables
  *          * ICL_Exec() to manage the ICL state machine
  *          * ICL_GetState() to get the current ICL state machine
